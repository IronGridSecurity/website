<p>“Never trust, always verify” is the essence of Zero Trust. But beyond the catchy phrase, Zero Trust requires fundamental architectural changes in how businesses manage identities, networks, and devices. This post explores the building blocks and misconceptions around Zero Trust adoption.</p>
<p>One of the biggest myths is that installing MFA equals Zero Trust. While MFA is a pillar, it’s not a strategy. True Zero Trust requires:
<ul>
<li>Continuous monitoring of identity and device health</li>
<li>Enforcing least privilege access across services</li>
<li>Using context-aware policies for access control</li>
</ul>
<p>We implemented Zero Trust principles for a remote-first organization by integrating conditional access policies in Azure AD, segmenting internal networks with VLANs, and adopting device compliance standards via Intune. The result was a more agile, secure posture with reduced attack surface and improved auditability.</p>
