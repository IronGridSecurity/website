<p>Log aggregation isn’t just for compliance—it’s the backbone of modern detection and response. This article dives into how log aggregation helps security teams gain visibility, reduce dwell time, and catch attacks in progress.</p>
<p>Security events often leave traces across multiple systems: a suspicious login, an endpoint anomaly, a DNS query. Without a central view, these clues remain isolated and go unnoticed. Log aggregation platforms like ELK, Splunk, and Graylog allow you to centralize logs, normalize fields, and build real-time alerts across environments.</p>
<h2>Real-World Impact</h2>
<p>One of our clients was hit with a brute force attack on VPN credentials. Because their logs were fragmented, they only noticed it two days later. After implementing centralized logging and correlation rules, similar attacks were detected and blocked within minutes.</p>
<p>Whether you’re in a small business or an enterprise, start with centralizing firewall, authentication, and endpoint logs. Then build use cases to drive alerts and dashboards that matter.</p>
